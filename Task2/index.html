        <h2>Awards and honors</h2>
        <p>Nikola Tesla, a pioneering inventor and electrical engineer, received several awards and honors during his lifetime and posthumously to recognize his significant contributions to science and technology. Some of the notable awards and honors bestowed upon him include:

            Edison Medal (1917): Awarded by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE) in recognition of Tesla's outstanding achievements in the field of electrical engineering.
            
            Order of St. Sava (1892): Tesla was decorated with the Order of St. Sava, a Serbian national order, for his contributions to his homeland and his achievements as an inventor.
            
            The Order of the White Eagle (Tesla received this order from the Yugoslav government in 1936, recognizing his exceptional contributions to science and technology).
            
            The University of Paris Medal (1892): Tesla received this honor for his contributions to the field of electrical engineering and the development of alternating current systems.
            
            The John Scott Medal (1934): Awarded to Tesla for his work on wireless transmission and his contributions to the field of electrical engineering.
            
            While Tesla's work and ideas gained recognition and accolades during his lifetime, it is essential to note that he also faced significant challenges and financial difficulties, which limited the extent of official recognition during his era. 
            Nevertheless, Tesla's legacy has grown significantly in the years following his death, and he is now widely celebrated as one of the greatest inventors and visionaries in history. His name and contributions continue to be honored and remembered through various awards, memorials, and scientific accolades, cementing his place as a key figure in the advancement of modern technology.</p>
